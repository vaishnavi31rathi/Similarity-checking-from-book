**📚 Similarity Checking from books**

**🎯 Overview**
A sophisticated text analysis initiative exploring connections among 64 literary masterpieces. By utilizing advanced comparison techniques, this project reveals hidden patterns and similarities within classic literature.

**✨ Key Features**
 • Identifies the 100 most impactful words across the collection.
 • Creates a detailed 64x64 similarity matrix.
 • Highlights the 10 most closely related book pairs.
 • Performs precise processing and analysis of raw text data.
 • Implements reliable and robust comparison algorithms.

**📊 Key Insights**
The analysis uncovered some intriguing relationships between books, including:
 • High similarity (91% match) between Volumes 3 and 4 of Gerard’s Herbal.
 • Strong narrative consistency across volumes of Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington.
 • Thematic coherence across different sections of Foxes Book of Martyrs.

**🛠 Technical Implementation**
Core Components
 • Custom Book class for efficient text representation.
 • Advanced text preprocessing framework.
 • Powerful algorithms for similarity calculations.
 • In-depth word frequency analysis.

**Technology Stack**
 • Programming Language: C++
 • Input Format: Raw text files
 • Analytical Approach: Statistical text comparison

**📈 Performance**
The program effectively processes all 64 books, performing:
 • Word frequency analysis for the entire dataset.
 • 2,016 unique pairwise book comparisons.
 • Similarity ranking and sorting for insights.

**🚀 How to Start**
 1. Clone the project repository.
 2. Place all book text files in the specified directory.
